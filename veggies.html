    <h1>Veggies</h1>
    <p>Our farm produces “all the vegetables” (ok, except for stalk celery, because Jenn doesn’t like it, and “What if we didn’t sell it all?! I’d have to eat it!”). We do our best to have as much variety at any given point given the limitations of a four-season system. </p>
	<p>The 2016 season saw the addition of a low tunnel to extend many crops into the deep winter and baby some of our pickier summer crops, and a new propagation house was built in the spring of 2017. Now, visions of gothic high tunnels dance in our heads, but time will tell when you can start being excited about the goodies from a really big structure. For now, we encourage folks to cook seasonally and we try to bring colorful and diverse sundries to all our markets.</p>
