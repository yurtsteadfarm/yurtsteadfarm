    <h1>Turkey Orders</h1>
    <p>Our turkeys are non-GMO, pasture-raised heritage birds. We raise Bourbon Reds, Standard Bronzes, and Royal Palms.</p>
    <p>This year the turkeys have been moved continuously on a mixed red-clover, alfalfa pasture, and they have enjoyed eating (and playing with) tomatoes, cucumbers, summer squash, carrot tops, grasshoppers, and pecking at Jenn's buttons. They are $7 a lb and range in size between 9 and 22 lbs.</p>
    <p>We'll post info here for 2019 Thanksgiving turkey orders.</p>
